# JoltCore Spark 16 (JCS16)

This is a fun little project I did in 2 weeks on vacation. It is an
extension of my 8-bit CPU with 8 general purpose 16 bit registers,
I/O ports, up to 64K RAM and ROM, basic maths and logical
instructions, a tiny assembler and more.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The entire CPU is a custom design, from bit shifter to I/O system.

> [!NOTE]
> You need Logisim Evolution to use this project.
> It is an open source logic simulator available here:
> https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution

You can find the assembler in the respective folder. It is written in
Python. You can find built programs in the `examples` folder.
To use a program, copy the entire content of the `.hex` file and
paste it into the ROM inside of Logisim Evolution.


The source for these programs is inside of the `programs` folder.

**Have fun!**
